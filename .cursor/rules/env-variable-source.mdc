# Your rule content

**IMPORTANT:** Due to security restrictions, the standard `.env` file is **not directly accessible**.

For any task requiring environment variable values (e.g., API keys, URLs), **you must consult the following file instead:**

*   [env-info.md](mdc:.cursor/docs/mvp/env-info.md)

This file (`env-info.md`) mirrors the structure and content of the actual `.env` file. Use the values found in `env-info.md` as if they were read directly from `.env`.

**Do not attempt to read or request access to the `.env` file itself.**
